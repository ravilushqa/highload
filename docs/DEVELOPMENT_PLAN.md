    *   All key Go libraries and dependencies are either platform-agnostic or provide ARM64 builds.
    *   Third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, external APIs) accessed by the application are not affected by the server-side architecture change.
*   **Performance Characteristics:**
    *   ARM architecture will provide comparable or better performance per dollar for the project's workloads.
    *   Any performance regressions identified can be mitigated through code optimization or configuration changes.
*   **Tooling and Ecosystem:**
    *   Development tools (IDE, debuggers, linters) for Go work effectively for ARM targets (either natively or via emulation/cross-compilation).
    *   CI/CD systems can be configured to build and test for ARM64 architecture.
    *   Monitoring and logging tools are compatible with ARM environments.
*   **Migration Feasibility:**

### Phase 1: Docker Image Compatibility Analysis and Required Updates

*   **Description:** Analyze existing Docker images for ARM compatibility, identify base images needing replacement (e.g., `amd64/` to `arm64v8/` or multi-arch images), and outline steps for rebuilding or updating Dockerfiles.
*   **Key Files to Review:** Root [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile:1), [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml:1), [`docker/prometheus/Dockerfile`](docker/prometheus/Dockerfile:1), [`docker/proxysql/Dockerfile`](docker/proxysql/Dockerfile:1), [`docker/tarantool/Dockerfile`](docker/tarantool/Dockerfile:1), [`docker/web/Dockerfile`](docker/web/Dockerfile:1), and any other custom Dockerfiles.
*   **Success Criteria:**
    *   All Docker images used by the project successfully build and run on an `arm64v8` architecture.
    *   A comprehensive list of all Docker images, their original architecture, and their new ARM-compatible counterparts (or multi-arch tags) is documented.
    *   All `Dockerfiles` are updated to use ARM-compatible base images (e.g., `arm64v8/golang`, `arm64v8/mysql`) or multi-arch images.
    *   `docker-compose.yml` is updated to specify ARM or multi-arch images where necessary.
*   **Potential Risks:**
    *   Some base images may not have official `arm64v8` support.
    *   Custom-built images might rely on x86-specific binaries or build steps.
    *   Performance issues with emulated x86 images if used as a temporary workaround.
    *   Increased build times for multi-arch images.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Prioritize official multi-arch images or `arm64v8`-specific tags.
    *   If official ARM images are unavailable, explore community-supported images or plan to build custom ARM base images.
    *   For x86-specific binaries in custom images, find ARM alternatives or recompile from source for ARM.
    *   Utilize native ARM builders in CI/CD to speed up build times.
*   **Testing Requirements:**
    *   **Build Tests:** Verify all Docker images build successfully on an ARM64 platform (or cross-build for ARM64).
    *   **Runtime Tests:** Deploy containers from new images on an ARM64 host/emulator and perform basic smoke tests to ensure services start and are responsive.
    *   **Compatibility Tests:** Ensure that services running in ARM containers can communicate with each other as expected.

### Phase 2: Configuration Modifications Needed for ARM Support

*   **Description:** Identify configuration files (e.g., deployment scripts, CI/CD pipelines, service configurations) requiring changes for ARM and detail necessary modifications.
*   **Key Files/Systems to Review:** [`Makefile`](Makefile:1), CI/CD pipeline configurations (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkinsfile), deployment scripts (Bash, Python, etc.), service configuration files (e.g., [`docker/centrifugo/config.json`](docker/centrifugo/config.json:1), [`docker/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`](docker/haproxy/haproxy.cfg:1), [`docker/mysql/*.cnf`](docker/mysql/slave1.cnf:1), [`docker/prometheus/prometheus.yml`](docker/prometheus/prometheus.yml:1), [`docker/proxysql/proxysql.cnf`](docker/proxysql/proxysql.cnf:1), various `services/**/config.go` files if they contain arch-specific paths or settings).
*   **Success Criteria:**
    *   All relevant configuration files and scripts are updated to support ARM64 deployment and operation.
    *   CI/CD pipelines are configured to build, test, and deploy for ARM64 targets.
    *   Deployment scripts correctly target ARM environments and use appropriate architecture flags.
    *   Service configurations are validated for ARM (e.g., no hardcoded x86 paths or settings).
*   **Potential Risks:**
    *   Hardcoded architecture assumptions in scripts or configuration files.
    *   CI/CD tooling may lack mature ARM support or require significant reconfiguration.
    *   Environment-specific configurations might be overlooked.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly audit all scripts and configuration files for architecture-specific settings. Use variables for architecture flags.
    *   Research and select CI/CD runners/tools with good ARM support (e.g., native ARM runners, Docker Buildx for multi-arch builds).
    *   Implement a configuration management strategy that handles platform differences gracefully.
    *   Version control all configuration changes.
*   **Testing Requirements:**
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Tests:** Full pipeline execution (build, test, deploy) targeting an ARM environment.
    *   **Deployment Tests:** Successful deployment to a staging/test ARM environment using updated scripts.
    *   **Configuration Validation:** Verify services start and run correctly with updated configurations on ARM.

### Phase 3: Dependencies and Library Version Upgrades

*   **Description:** Audit all project dependencies (programming language libraries, third-party tools) for ARM compatibility. Identify libraries requiring updates or replacement. Plan for version upgrades, noting potential breaking changes.
*   **Key Files to Review:** [`go.mod`](go.mod:1), [`go.sum`](go.sum:1), any vendor directories, documentation for third-party tools.
*   **Success Criteria:**
    *   All Go dependencies are confirmed to be ARM64 compatible or have ARM64 compatible alternatives.
    *   A compatibility matrix for all key dependencies (Go libraries, system tools) is created, noting current version, target ARM-compatible version, and any known issues or migration notes.
    *   Necessary library upgrades are performed and tested.
    *   The project successfully compiles (`go build ./...`) and all unit/integration tests pass when targeting `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64`.
*   **Potential Risks:**
    *   Critical libraries may lack ARM64 support or have unstable ARM versions.
    *   Version upgrades might introduce breaking changes or regressions.
    *   Hidden dependencies (e.g., C libraries via cgo) might have ARM compatibility issues.
    *   Time-consuming process if many libraries need updates or replacements.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Prioritize libraries with official ARM64 support.
    *   If a library is incompatible, search for forks, alternatives, or consider contributing ARM support upstream.
    *   Address breaking changes from version upgrades incrementally.
    *   Thoroughly investigate any cgo dependencies using `go list -f '{{.CgoFiles}}' ./...` and ensure cross-compilers and ARM libraries are available.
    *   Allocate sufficient time for dependency audit and upgrades.
*   **Testing Requirements:**
    *   **Compilation Tests:** Successful cross-compilation of all Go services for `linux/arm64`.
    *   **Unit Tests:** All existing unit tests must pass when run against ARM-compiled binaries (either natively on ARM or emulated).
    *   **Integration Tests:** Key integration tests must pass in an ARM environment.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools like `nancy` (for Go) or Snyk/Dependabot to identify vulnerabilities in new versions.
    *   **Compatibility Matrix (Example Snippet):**
        | Dependency Name | Current Version (x86) | Target Version (ARM64) | ARM64 Support | Notes / Breaking Changes |
        |-----------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
        | `github.com/gin-gonic/gin` | `v1.7.0`              | `v1.9.1` or latest     | Yes (pure Go)   | Review release notes     |
        | `mysql-driver`  | `[version]`           | `[latest_arm_compat]`  | Check           | Test thoroughly          |
        | `[cgo_dependency]`| `[version]`           | `[version_or_alt]`     | Requires investigation | Potential build complexity |

    *   Poor performance of emulated ARM environments on x86 developer machines.
    *   Complexity in setting up and maintaining emulated environments.
    *   Inconsistencies between emulated local environments and native ARM production.
    *   Tooling (debuggers, IDE integrations) might have limitations with emulated/cross-compiled ARM binaries.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Provide powerful enough developer machines if emulation is heavy.
    *   Encourage use of native ARM development machines (e.g., Apple Silicon Macs) where available.
    *   Use lightweight virtualization or container-based emulation (e.g., Docker Desktop's Rosetta integration or QEMU user-mode).
    *   Invest in cloud-based ARM development instances if local options are insufficient.
