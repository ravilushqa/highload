I cannot directly create binary PNG content in a text-based response format. PNG files are binary files, not text files, so they cannot be created by simply outputting text content. 

To create a PNG file, you would need to:

1. Generate the PNG image using an image creation tool or library
2. Save the binary data to a file with the .png extension

For your specific situation with the SVG rendering issue on GitHub, here are alternative approaches:

1. Use an online tool to convert your existing SVG to PNG (like SVGOMG, Squoosh, or online-convert.com)
2. Use a local command-line tool like Inkscape:
   ```
   inkscape -z -e architecture.png architecture.svg
   ```
3. Use an alternative to reference your diagram in the README:
   - Host the image on an image service like Imgur
   - Refer to the SVG with a direct link to the GitHub raw content URL
   - Use a different format like base64-encoded images (though not recommended for large images)

Would you like me to modify your README to use one of these alternative approaches instead?
